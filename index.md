## Hi, I'm Mihai.

### Tinkerer 🪛, wilderness lover 🏔, and fan of all things 2 wheels 🛵.

I'm that guy who can entertain any idea and am constantly trying new things. I enjoy having a routine but I also love learning ways to consciously improve it.

I'm a Romanian-Canadian working at [Plastiq](https://www.linkedin.com/company/plastiq) as a Software Engineer, however am actively seeking new opportunities. I studied Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

What gets me excited

* startups
* delivering high business value @ minimal cost
* high responsibility / being an essential individual contributor
* resourcefully challenging tasks / collaborating across teams & departments
* making a meaningful direct / indirect impact on society
* a career in any of social, financial, medical, environmental, fitness, wellness, or mental health industries
