## Hi, I'm Mihai.

### I'm a tinkerer, wilderness lover, and fan of all things 2 wheels.

I'm that guy who can entertain any idea and am constantly trying new things. I enjoy having a routine but I also love learning ways to consciously improve it. 

I'm currently working at [Plastiq](https://www.linkedin.com/company/plastiq) as a Software Engineer, however am actively seeking new opportunities.

What gets me excited
- startups
- delivering high business value @ minimal cost
- high responsibility / being an essential individual contributor
- resourcefully challenging tasks / collaborating across teams & departments
- making a meaningful direct / indirect impact on society
- a career in any of social, financial, medical, environmental, fitness, wellness, or mental health industries
